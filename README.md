Meow Feed is a smart cat feeder designed for the modern pet owner. With just a tap on your smartphone, you can feed your cat from anywhere in the world.
It's not just about feeding your cat, it's about being present, even when you're miles away.

It comes equipped with a camera, allowing you to witness those adorable feeding moments live. So, even when you're away, you're still part of their routine, still part of their lives.
You have the power to instantly feed your cat or schedule feeding times according to your cat's dietary needs.

the Meow Feed comes with a smart plate that acts as a scale, giving you real-time weight of the food dispensed.
You can monitor how much your cat eats per day, per month, and the total weight.
